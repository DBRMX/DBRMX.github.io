            They've been sayin', "You're sophisticated"<br>
            They're complainin', overeducated<br>
            You are saying all the words I'm dreaming<br>
            Say it after me<br>
            Say it after me<br>
            They will blame us, crucify and shame us<br>
            We can't help it if we are a problem<br>
            We are tryin' hard to get your attention<br>
            I'm climbin' up your wall<br>

            Don't go there 'cause you'll never return<br>

            But then it don't make sense when you're tryin' hard<br>
            To do the right thing but without recompense<br>
            And then you did something wrong and you said it was great<br>
            And now you don't know how you could ever complain<br>
            Because you're all confused 'cause you want me to<br>
            But then you want me to do it the same as you
            <br><br>
            You were waitin' for the elevator<br>
            You were sayin' all the words I'm dreaming<br>
            No more askin' questions or excuses<br>
            Information's here<br>
            Here and everywhere
            <br><br>
            Don't go there 'cause you'll never return<br>

            I don't, I don't want anything<br>
            I know it's not, it's not your fault<br>
            I don't want anyone<br>
            Always I do, it's not for you
